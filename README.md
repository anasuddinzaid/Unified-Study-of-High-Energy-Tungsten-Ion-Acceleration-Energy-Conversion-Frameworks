# Unified-Study-of-High-Energy-Tungsten-Ion-Acceleration-Energy-Conversion-Frameworks
Independent research (age 17) unifying relativistic tungsten ion acceleration (to 0.99c) and abstract energy conversion frameworks. Includes Lorentz factors, momentum scaling, thermodynamic modeling, simulation roadmap (Monte Carlo, PIC, GEANT4), and facility/ethical considerations. Conceptual only.
